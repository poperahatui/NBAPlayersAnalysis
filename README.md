In this portfolio, I tried data processing, exploration and manipulation, and made the following visualizations:
- Data Collection: Utilized programming techniques to systematically gather data from various sources.
- Exploration and Manipulation: Employed the pandas, numpy, scipy library in Python to explore, assess, and manipulate the collected data. This involved tasks such as cleaning data, handling missing values, and transforming datasets to facilitate analysis.
- Create Compelling Visualizations: Leverage the capabilities of pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to create visually appealing tables that effectively summarize and present key insights from the processed data.
